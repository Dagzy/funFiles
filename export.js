//Explain Export
//The export statement is used when creating JavaScript modules to export functions, 
//objects, or primitive values from the module so they can be used by other programs;;;
//There are two different types of export, named and default. 
//You can have multiple named exports per module but ONLY ONE default export

export const myObj = {
    name: "some object!",
    color: "extra"
}
